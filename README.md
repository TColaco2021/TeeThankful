Hi, I’m Terence Colaco and I am currently enjoying the cybersecurity bootcamp program through the University of Toronto. I will complete the program in December of 2021 and 
and can't wait to begin my cybersecurity career. In my present role I am working towards becoming a certified IMIS software admin to obtain some more practical day to day workplace experiences with IT administration.

I’m interested in becoming a SOC or SIEM analyst as I am fascinated by the prospect of working within a team to monitor and fight threats to an organization's IT infrastructure. 
Identifying security weaknesses and opportunities for potential improvements appeal to my curious, proactive and competitive nature as well. 

I’m currently gaining experience with a host of popular tools such as Wireshark, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nessus, and more. The U of T SCS Cybersecurity Boot Camp 
has been challenging and very rewarding. I've enjoyed this multidisciplinary approach in attaining proficiency in IT, networking, and modern information security, 
throughout the course. I am earning skills applicable to certifications such as the CompTIA Security+, Network+, Linux+, Server+, Cloud+ and certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).

I’m looking to network with prospective and current IT industry professionals to learn and share experiences and knowledge. Any conversation would be appreciated as I
continue to humbly and passionately enjoy my journey.
